# ROS2 Simulation Packages Repository

Welcome to the ROS2 Simulation Packages Repository! This repository serves as a collection of various ROS2 simulation packages for different purposes. Each package is designed to simulate specific aspects of ROS2 functionality and is independently maintained.

## Overview

ROS 2 (Robot Operating System 2) is a set of software libraries and tools for building robot applications. Simulation is an essential part of robotics development, allowing developers to test algorithms, behaviors, and interactions in a virtual environment before deploying them onto physical robots.

This repository hosts a variety of simulation packages covering different aspects of ROS2, including but not limited to:

- Robot kinematics and dynamics simulation
- Sensor simulation (e.g., LiDAR, camera, IMU)
- Environment simulation (e.g., maps, obstacles)
- Behavior simulation (e.g., navigation, manipulation)

## Packages

Each package in this repository contains detailed information and instructions within its own README file. Please refer to the README of each package for specific usage, installation instructions, and additional details.

### [slm_sim](https://github.com/andrea2702/ROS2_Learning/tree/main/slm_sim)

Simulates the dynamics of a pendulum in Rviz.

### [Localization](https://github.com/andrea2702/ROS2_Learning/tree/main/localization)

Calculate the kinematics of a robot with two wheels and show the results in Rviz.
